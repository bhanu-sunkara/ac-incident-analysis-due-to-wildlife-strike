Wild life Strike(bird/bats/ground animals) is common and can be a significant threat to aircraft safety. With the increase in the airtraffic the number of incidents recording also increasing significantly. For smaller aircraft, significant damage may be caused to the aircraft structure and all aircraft, especially jet-engined ones, are vulnerable to the loss of thrust which can follow the ingestion of birds into engine air intakes. This has resulted in a number of fatal accidents.Bird strikes may occur during any phase of flight but are most likely during the take-off, initial climb, approach and landing phases due to the greater numbers of birds in flight at lower levels. So, develop a machine learning model which will provide some meaningful insights of the regions in which more wild life strikes involved, type of species involved in the strikes etc.,
